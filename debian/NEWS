bitcoin (0.3.21~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bitcoin is now linked against Berkeley DB 5.1, and from now on
    follows the default recommended version of BerkeleyDB.

    Bitcoin unfortunately does not automatically update its database, so
    if you experience problems, please refer to

      /usr/share/doc/bitcoind/README.Debian

    for information on how to fix it.
