bitcoin (0.3.19~dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version of Bitcoin switches to Berkeley DB 4.8.  Earlier
    Debian releases (and upstream binaries too) use Berkeley DB 4.7.

    Bitcoin unfortunately does not automatically update its database, so
    if you experience problems, please refer to

      /usr/share/doc/netatalk/README.Debian

    for information on how to fix it.
